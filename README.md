# Paris Bible Project ground truth

In this repository you will find some of the ground truth used to create the models for the [Paris Bible Project](parisbible.github.io).

Our central aim is to study the production and diffusion of Latin Bibles throughout 13th and 14th century Europe. In the interest of diversifying the data we have opted for a wide variety of manuscript folios, some of which may not in the public domain. We have chosen to include a variety of samples in training our models, even when we cannot point to specific digitized versions in the public domain. We are aware that this curtails full reproducibility. At the same time, we hope that it helps us mitigate against bias in under-digitized collections.

Metadata about the manuscripts used can be found in each folder.  Additional metadata about the manuscripts used can be found in the latest version of our [List of Paris Bibles in the World](10.5281/zenodo.7274507).
