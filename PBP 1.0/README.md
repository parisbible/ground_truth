# Paris Bible Project model 1.0 (PBP 1.0) 

This folder contains most of the ground truth used to train the PBP 1.0 model in Transkribus with Pylaia. Here you will find the GT for the documents which are publicly available, (approximately 20% of the folios used for model training are not included). 

Our central aim is to study the production and diffusion of Latin Bibles throughout 13th and 14th century Europe. In the interest of diversifying the data in PBP 1.0 we have opted for a wide variety of manuscript folios, some of which are not in the public domain. We have chosen to include a variety of samples in training our models, even when we cannot point to specific digitized versions in the public domain. We are aware that this curtails full reproducibility. At the same time, we hope that it helps us mitigate against bias in under-digitized collections. 

For this model we also used a base model using the previous ground truth found in this same repository.

Metadata for the pages of ground truth can be found in the csv file in this folder.
